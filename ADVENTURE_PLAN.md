Choose your own adventure: The Lost Treasure of Eldoria
Setting: You are an adventurous explorer searching for the legendary treasure hidden deep within the enchanted forest of Eldoria.

Start:
You stand at the edge of the enchanted forest. Rumors of a lost treasure have lured you here, 
but the forest is known for its magical creatures and tricky paths.

    Decision Point 1: How do you enter the forest?
        1. Take the well-trodden path.
        2. Venture off the beaten track into the dense underbrush.

    Path 1: The Well-Trodden Path
    You decide to take the safe route. As you walk, you encounter a group of friendly woodland creatures who offer to guide you to the treasure.

        Decision Point 2: Do you trust the creatures?
            1. Accept their help and follow them.
            2. Politely decline and continue on your own

            If you accept their help:
            The creatures lead you to a hidden glade where the treasure lies. You find chests filled with gold and gems! 
            You thank your new friends and leave the forest as a wealthy explorer.

            You win!

            If you decline:
            You wander deeper into the forest but soon get lost. After hours of searching, you stumble upon a mystical pond. 
            A wise old spirit offers you a chance to find your way out in exchange for a riddle.

            You choose:
                1. Attempt to solve the riddle.
                2. Ask the spirit for another way out.

                If you attempt to solve the riddle:
                After your attempt, white light surges from the spirit blinding you. You blink and look around and realize you're back at the edge of the forest 
                but the well trodden path you took is nowhere to be seen.

                If you ask for another way out.
                White light surges from the spirit blinding you. You blink and look around finding both the pond and the spirit gone.


    Path 2: The Dense Underbrush
    You push through the thick foliage and discover an ancient, overgrown temple. It looks abandoned, but you sense powerful magic inside.

        Decision Point 2: Do you enter the temple?
            1. Cautiously explore inside.
            2. Turn back and look for another way to the treasure.

            If you explore the temple:
            Inside, you find a magical artifact that reveals the treasureâ€™s location! You navigate the temple's puzzles and escape with the treasure in hand.

            You win!

            If you turn back:
