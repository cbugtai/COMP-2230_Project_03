1. Can I explain what my code does?
    - The index.html is the container for me elements,
    - The script.js holds most of my code, it has all the possible scenarios for my interactive adventure and just cycles through them
    - the styles.css is where i make my website look nicer for users

2. What was my coding process?
    - I broke the problem down to managable parts so for the interactive adventure, i did each scenario one by one until i got all of them

3. What challenges did I have?
    - Given that im new to javascript there were some things that i didnt know that worked against me 
      for example I didnt know event listeners stack so when i was trying out my code and it wasnt going to the scenario i want it to go
      i didnt know where to start troubleshooting the issue.

4. What would I do differently now?
    - create variables for all the elements that i might use in my code form the beginning so that i dont have to add it to the index later
    - remember to add classes to functions for easier styling
